# Debt Tracker <br>
## Team Members: Walter Villa, Melody Chiu

### Project Goals <br>
Our goal for this project is to create a program that is useful to students. A debt tracker is something useful that we would use within our suite, and we can imagine it being useful to other people who need to keep track of monetary exchanges. We're also interested in having a user-interactive aspect to our project which our application achieves by taking in user input and outputs information that is useful to them.

### Learning Goals <br>
Through this project, we hope to become more comfortable programming in C. We would like to learn about how to manage data flow in an application built in C.

### Getting Starting <br>
A major starting resource is online research into existing data management applications. This will give us information on which data structures would be useful for our application and how to implement them in C. We would also like to consult the teaching team on where would be a good place to begin tackling our project.

### First Steps <br>
* Document to story board / plan for features of the application
* Do research on data structures that we may use
* Look into which libraries we may need to include
